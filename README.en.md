## ✨ What it does

VoCript listens to your **voice** —or the **audio playing on your PC**— and turns it into text **right where your cursor is**, in any app. All recognition happens **on your device**: no accounts, no cloud, no waiting.

- 🎤 **Voice dictation** — press a shortcut, speak, and the text types itself into whatever app you're using.
- 🔊 **System audio** — transcribe what's playing on your PC (a video, a call, a meeting) or a specific app, and optionally tag where it came from.
- ⚡ **Live transcription** — watch the text appear word by word in a floating bubble as you speak or play audio.
- 📁 **Files to text or subtitles** — drop in an audio or video file and get plain text or `.srt` subtitles.
- 🎯 **Accuracy your way** — a **personal dictionary** of exact replacements plus **custom words** that fix names or jargon by how they sound (with CSV import/export).
- 💼 **Work profiles** — *Normal*, *Coding* (dictate symbols: "at sign" → `@`, "semicolon" → `;`) or *Custom* with your own commands.
- 🌍 **Multi-language** — interface in 20 languages and transcription in dozens, with a **quick language switch** (app and model at once). Tuned for Spanish accents and punctuation.
- 🕑 **History** — keeps your transcriptions and lets you replay the original audio anytime.
- 🎨 **Make it yours** — light, dark or **automatic (follows your system)** theme. On first launch it picks up your device's **language and theme**, then a quick guided tour shows you the basics.
- 🔒 **100% local** — no telemetry, with automatic, signed updates.
