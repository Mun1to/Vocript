## ✨ What it does

VoCript turns your voice into text instantly, **right where your cursor is**.
All recognition happens **on your device** — your audio never leaves your computer.

- 🎤 **Voice dictation** — press a shortcut, speak, and the text is typed into any app.
- 🖥️ **System audio** — transcribe what's playing on your PC (a video, a call) or a specific app.
- 📁 **File transcription** — turn audio or video into text or `.srt` subtitles.
- ⚡ **Live transcription** — watch the text in a floating bubble as you speak (push-to-talk).
- 📒 **Personal dictionary** — exact replacements for names, jargon or abbreviations, with CSV import/export.
- 🕑 **History** — keeps your transcriptions and lets you replay the original audio.
- 🌐 **Multi-language** via Whisper (tuned for Spanish accents and punctuation out of the box).

## ⬇️ Download

1. Go to **[the latest release (Releases)](https://github.com/Mun1to/Vocript/releases/latest)**.
2. Download the installer `VoCript_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe`.
3. Run it and follow the steps. Done!

> Windows may show an "unknown publisher" warning (the app isn't signed with a
> paid certificate yet). Click **More info → Run anyway**.

## 🔄 Automatic updates

VoCript updates **itself**: on launch it checks for a new version and, if there
is one, installs it with a single click. No manual re-downloading.

---

## ⌨️ How to use it

1. Open VoCript (it lives in the system tray, next to the clock).
2. On first run, download a transcription model (Whisper).
3. Place your cursor where you want to type, press the **dictation shortcut**, speak and release.
4. The text appears where your cursor was.

All shortcuts are configurable in **Settings → General**.

## 🔒 Privacy

VoCript runs **100% locally**. No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry: your voice
and transcriptions **never leave your computer**. Optional cloud AI
post-processing is off by default.
